# ULF Static page
## ULF project relation
- Required module

## Description
The static page content type provides a way for users with the editor role to provide static pages.
- Holds configuration for the static_page content type.
- Holds fields instances related to the static_page content type.
- Note: Holds a field base for field_content. That is a minor error.
The field base for that field should have been defined in
features/ulf_field_bases module. This part of the module should be refactured.
