# ULF HTML block
## ULF project relation
- Required module

## Description
- Holds configuration for the html_block entity
- Holds field instances related to the html_block entity.
- Holds a field base for field_html_custom_image. That is a minor error.
The field base for that field should have been defined in
features/ulf_field_bases module. This part of the module should be refactured.
